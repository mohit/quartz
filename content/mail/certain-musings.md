### from me, relaying a converastion with a teacher about a popular academic

B loathes the fact that MPR has done nothing in life except theorize. B said that at some point you have to make a concious choice to allow yourself to fail ( continue doing things), get laughed at, sneered at (still keep creating). 

I can not claim fully understanding what this means. She told us about sabzi markets in India.
